A port of the python library fabulous to C

The python library [fabulous](https://github.com/jart/fabulous) is as the name implies, fabulous.
however it hasn't seen an update in a while. libfab is a port of the core functionality of fabulous to C.
Once it is ported wrappers to other languages can be made. I'm working on this to improve my knowledge of C,
and to improve upon a library I enjoy using.
